## More singly linked lists

Introduction
Singly Linked Lists are a foundational data structure in computer science and software development. They provide an efficient way to store and manipulate collections of data in a sequential manner.

Node Structure
In a Singly Linked List, each element, known as a "node," consists of two main components:

Data: This field holds the actual value or information you want to store.
Next: This is a reference to the next node in the sequence. In the last node, the "Next" pointer is typically set to null to indicate the end of the list.
Key Operations
Singly Linked Lists support several fundamental operations:

1. Insertion
a. Insert at the beginning:
To insert a new node at the beginning, you update the "Next" of the new node to point to the current head, and then update the head to the new node.

b. Insert at the end:
To insert a new node at the end, you traverse the list until you reach the last node and update the "Next" of the last node to point to the new node.

2. Deletion
a. Delete from the beginning:
To delete the first node, update the head to point to the next node in the list.

3. Traversal
To traverse a Singly Linked List, start from the head and follow the "Next" pointers until you reach the end (when "Next" is null).

Advantages
Efficient for insertion and deletion at the beginning.
Memory-efficient as nodes can be allocated and deallocated easily.
Limitations
Inefficient for accessing elements by index.
Does not support bidirectional traversal.
Common Use Cases
Singly Linked Lists are used in various applications, including implementing data structures like stacks and queues, as well as managing dynamic lists of items.
